# Food Recommendation System

## Overview

This project entails the development of a Food Recommendation System using Python and machine learning techniques. The system aims to provide personalized food recommendations to users based on their preferences, past interactions, and trending items. It leverages collaborative filtering and popularity-based filtering methodologies to enhance the recommendation process.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning-Based Recommendations**: Utilized Python's machine learning libraries to implement collaborative filtering algorithms. These algorithms analyze user data, including past orders and interactions, to suggest relevant food items.

- **Personalization**: The system takes into account user preferences, restrictions, and past behaviors to tailor recommendations for each individual user.

- **Popularity-Based Filtering**: Alongside personalized recommendations, the system incorporates popularity-based filtering to suggest trending and frequently purchased food items to users.

- **User Interface**: Developed a user interface that allows users to explore recommendations, browse details of food items, and provide feedback on suggested items.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for system development and implementation of machine learning algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Utilized machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for implementing recommendation algorithms.
- **User Interface Framework**: Employed frameworks like Flask or Django for building the user interface.
- **Database**: Integrated a database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store user data and food item details.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with External Platforms**: Explore options to integrate the recommendation system with external platforms like food delivery apps for seamless user experience.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Continuously improve the recommendation algorithms to enhance personalization and accuracy.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time updates to adapt recommendations based on changing user preferences and trends.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Enhance the feedback mechanism to gather more detailed insights from users, facilitating further improvements in recommendations.
